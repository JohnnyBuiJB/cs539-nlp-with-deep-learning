\begin{task}{1.2} 
Sampling-based generated texts
\end{task}
\textbf{Argument}

Below are the texts generated by the sampling-based method. First, the Vanilla generated the same text as top-p, p=1 because they are technically the same thing. Softmax outputs a normalized distribution whose sum is 1. Applying top-p with p=1 on a normalized distribution effectively keeps all elements in it. 

Second, (2) and (4) output similar texts because they basically only focus on a few most likely words (2), or only the most likely word (4). However, (6) might generate different texts because there might be many smallest set of words, especially in case that p is small. For example, in case p is set to be smaller than the probability of all words in the vocab, then any word can be the minimum set. Hence, the generated text boils down to how the algorithm is implemented. I implemented (4) using greedy algorithm to pick the word with the largest probability each time until the sum of probability exceeds p, and this guarantees to produce a minimum set. Therefore, (4) only focuses on the most likely words just like (2) and (6).
